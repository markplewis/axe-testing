1. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
2. If, for some reason, you don't have a copy of the Selenium standalone binary in your project folder, download it: `curl -O http://selenium-release.storage.googleapis.com/2.53/selenium-server-standalone-2.53.1.jar`
3. Start the server: `node server.js`
4. With the server still running, open a separate terminal tab and run the tests: `npm test`
